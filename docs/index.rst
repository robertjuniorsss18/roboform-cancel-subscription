### 5. **What Happens After You Cancel RoboForm Subscription?**

Once you’ve successfully canceled your RoboForm subscription, you can continue using the service until the end of the billing period. However, after that, you will lose access to the premium features of RoboForm, such as:

- **Cross-device sync**: Syncing your password vault across all devices will no longer be available.
- **Priority customer support**: You may no longer have access to priority customer service for troubleshooting.
- **Advanced features**: Features such as secure cloud storage, password generation, and encryption will be limited to the free version.

### 6. **Can You Get a Refund After Cancellation?**

RoboForm does not automatically issue refunds for canceled subscriptions, especially for those who cancel before the end of a billing cycle. However, you may be able to request a refund if:

- You feel there was an error in billing.
- You cancel within a short period after being charged.
- You have a valid reason that aligns with their refund policy.

If you’d like to request a refund, reach out to **RoboForm’s customer support** via their email or live chat support, and provide details about your request. They will review your case and determine whether a refund is possible.

### 7. **Consider Downgrading Instead of Canceling**

If you’re not entirely satisfied with the premium features but still want to keep using RoboForm, consider downgrading to the **free version** instead of fully canceling your subscription. RoboForm offers a free version that allows you to store and autofill passwords, though some features like syncing and advanced options will be limited.

To downgrade, simply cancel your premium subscription following the steps above, and you will automatically switch to the free version.

Tips for Managing RoboForm Subscription
----------------------------------------

- **Check Your Renewal Date**: To avoid being charged for an automatic renewal, check your **subscription renewal date** and cancel well in advance.
- **Backup Your Data**: Before canceling your subscription, make sure to **back up** your passwords and data. RoboForm offers an option to export your passwords so that you won’t lose them if you decide to switch to another service.
- **Review Your Account Settings**: Make sure you’re canceling the correct account or subscription type. If you have multiple accounts, verify which one you are canceling.
- **Stay Informed About Changes**: Sometimes RoboForm changes its subscription terms, so keep an eye on any announcements or updates that might affect your subscription.

Conclusion
----------

Canceling a RoboForm subscription is a straightforward process, whether you signed up via the website, Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or PayPal. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that you cancel your subscription efficiently and avoid unwanted charges.

If you’re considering leaving RoboForm, make sure to back up your data, and if you still want to use the service with limited features, the free version may be a suitable alternative. Should you need help with cancellation or refunds, RoboForm’s customer support team is available to assist you.
